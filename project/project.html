    <section class="design-rationale">
      <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        This website was designed to showcase the beauty and accessibility of Utah's National Parks. Every design choice was made with user experience, clarity, and visual appeal in mind.
      </p>

      <h3>Layout</h3>
      <p>
        The layout follows a clean, grid-based structure with a prominent hero image on the homepage to immediately capture attention. Navigation is fixed at the top for easy access, and content is organized into digestible sections with clear headings.
      </p>

      <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        Earth tones inspired by Utah’s natural landscapes — sandstone reds, pine greens, and sky blues — were selected to evoke a sense of place and adventure. These colors also provide strong contrast for readability.
      </p>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        The site uses a combination of a bold serif font for headings (to convey grandeur and tradition) and a clean sans-serif font for body text (to ensure legibility across devices).
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        All images include descriptive alt text. Color contrast meets WCAG standards, and the site is fully navigable via keyboard. Responsive design ensures usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>
        The site adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. On mobile, the navigation collapses into a hamburger menu, and content stacks vertically for easy scrolling.
